# Vivian Simulator 2014

Happy Birthday, Vivian.

## Oh my god what is this
Most of the time when we see Vivian's laptop screen, it's got an episode of Bones playing, 2048 in the background(?), another distracting window or two, and then finally whatever Vivian's working on.




You too can live this dream.

## How to play
1. Type as fast as you can. Seriously. That's how you start the game.
2. Read the paper, answer the questions about it, get the highest 2048 score you can, and for goodness' sake pay attention to the video, there's a quiz at the end.

###To-do list
~~Apologise to Vivian~~

###Trivia
The background image is Vivian's wallpaper (we think).
